//  Prompt 1: Diagnosing High CPU / Memory / Disk Usage on Linux VM 
You are a Senior Linux Infrastructure Engineer with deep expertise in VMware vSphere and Linux OS internals.
I am troubleshooting a production Linux VM running on VMware vSphere/ESXi that is experiencing intermittent performance degradation.




Symptoms:
- End users report slow application response
- VMware vCenter shows high CPU Ready Time intermittently
- Inside the Linux VM, CPU usage spikes occasionally, memory usage steadily increases, and disk I/O wait is observed during peak hours

Environment details-
- OS: RHEL/CentOS-based Linux
- VM is running on shared ESXi hosts
- VMware Tools is installed and running
- Application is multi-process (Java/Python-based)
- No recent ESXi host failures reported


I want you to:
1. Provide a structured, step-by-step diagnostic approach covering:
   - Linux OS level (CPU, memory, disk, processes)
   - VMware virtualization layer (CPU Ready, ballooning, swapping)
2. List exact Linux commands to run (top, htop, vmstat, iostat, free, sar, pidstat, lsof, etc.) and explain what to look for in their output.
3. Explain how to correlate Linux metrics with vSphere metrics (CPU Ready %, memory ballooning, datastore latency).
4. Identify common root causes (CPU overcommitment, memory leaks, noisy neighbors, disk contention, mis-sized VM).
5. Suggest immediate mitigation steps and long-term fixes (VM resizing, application tuning, reservations/limits, capacity planning).


Respond with clear sections, commands, interpretation guidance, and real-world operational tips.

  //1. Intent Behind This Prompt
-----The intent is to systematically diagnose performance issues across both the Linux OS and VMware virtualization layer, instead of treating them in isolation.

  2. How the AI’s Response Helps
------Provides a production-grade troubleshooting runbook

Helps correlate Linux metrics with vSphere metrics (critical in interviews)

Demonstrates understanding of CPU Ready Time, ballooning, swap, I/O wait
Can be directly reused during real incidents or on-call rotations


// Prompt 2: Designing Auto-Recovery Logic for an Unresponsive Linux VM

 You are an expert in Linux automation, reliability engineering, and VMware-based infrastructure operations.
I need to design an automated recovery mechanism for Linux virtual machines hosted on VMware vSphere.
Scenario:
- A Linux VM occasionally becomes unresponsive (SSH hangs, application health checks fail)
- VMware reports the VM as powered on, but OS-level services are stuck
- Manual intervention is currently required (service restart or VM reboot)

Requirements:
1. Design an auto-recovery workflow that:
   - Detects OS unresponsiveness using health checks (SSH, process checks, HTTP checks)
   - Attempts graceful recovery first (restart services)
   - Escalates to VM reboot only if required
2. Propose an architecture using:
   - Shell scripts or Python for health checks
   - Ansible for orchestration
   - Optional VMware APIs or PowerCLI logic for VM-level actions
3. Provide example scripts/playbooks for:
   - Health check logic
   - Decision-making (retry vs reboot)
   - Logging and alerting
4. Include safeguards to avoid reboot loops and false positives.
5. Explain how this solution would integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Nagios, Zabbix, or vCenter alarms).



  // Intent Behind This Prompt
----- The intent is to design a fault-tolerant, self-healing mechanism that reduces manual intervention and improves VM availability.
